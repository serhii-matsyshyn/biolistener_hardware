# BioListener Hardware

This repository contains all the necessary files related to the **BioListener project** hardware design, including **PCB source files**, **schematic files**, **fabrication files**, **BOM files**, and  **interactive BOM files**. The hardware designs are created in [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/), ensuring easy access and modification for further development.

### Evaluated Boards
The following boards are evaluated and tested as part of the BioListener project:

- **ADC AD7771** (Analog Devices)
- **ADC ADS131M08** (Texas Instruments)
